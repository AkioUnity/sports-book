    The object of Texas Holdem is to make the best 5 card poker 
	hand from the 5 community cards on the table and your own 
	2 cards that only you can see. The community cards are dealt 
	out during the hand with betting rounds in between so you 
	are betting on the likleyhood of forming a winning hand 
	by the end of the hand when all cards are revealed.<br>
	<br>
	A game consists of playing hands of cards and each hand 
	is split into alternating rounds of revealing cards and 
	betting on the results.<br>
	<br>
	Your good buddy has lent you $10K to join a high stakes 
	poker game. Whatever profit or loss you make whilst playing 
	in a game will be added or deducted from your total bankroll 
	whenever you leave a table. The total bankroll determines 
	your player ranking. <br>
	<br>
	Be careful not to lose the initial $10K or it's back to 
	your buddy to plead for more!<br>
